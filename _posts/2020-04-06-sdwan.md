[SD WAN Summary](https://www.netmanias.com/ko/sd-wan-portal/netmanias-sd-wan-analysis/1171/)


**128T Concept** 

Vector 
- It is Secure Vector Routing(SVR) which is from [128T](https://www.128technology.com/product-overview/). Instead of cost, 128T incorporates an innovative technique known as vectors.
- Vectors are a per-service policy attribute that assigns costs to segments to allow shared infrastructure to be used uniquely based on the type of traffic traversing it.
- The most common use case for configuring vectors is a system with connectivity to two Internet Service Providers(ISPs), where one ISP is preferred for a specific category of traffic and the other ISP is preffered for everything else.
- Traffic will always seek to find the path with the lowest(numerical) value for cost/priority.

The vector configuration process includes the following steps:
1. Assign neighborhoods and vectors to all relevant egress interfaces.
2. Apply preference values to vectors in one or more service-policy elements.
3. Apply the service-policy to the services to use these specific paths.
